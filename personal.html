                             software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals 
                             will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover
                              them all.<br>The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the 
                              front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web
                               engineering in the broader scope of web development.<br> Web designers are expected to have an awareness of

                            the website interactive.<br>

                            The server-side functionality of a website, including databases, web services, and APIs. Back-end developers use 
                            programming languages like JavaScript and SQL to create and maintain the backend components. <br>

                             rise in online activities.[1] Content writing services are firms, companies or group of writers that provide services
                              such as blog writing for websites, web content writing, marketing material content, white papers, research articles,

                            Content writing services generally charge a fixed per word rate which is popularly known as PPW (pay per word or price per word)
                            . However, many content writing firms also have pricing plans that offer fixed amount of content against subscription plans.</p>

                            Content management systems offer many features that empower you (and your team, if you have one) to manage the content on your website. 
                            Without a CMS, you’d be left making manual updates to any page that required changes. For example, if you wanted to update your the size 
                            of your headings, you’d have to do so across your entire website. A CMS removes this burden, allowing you to move much faster.
                             Most content management systems offer the following core features:<br>
                             Create, edit, and publish website content<br>
                            Search through your repository of content<br>
